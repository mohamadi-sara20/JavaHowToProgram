package ir.phgnight;
//Create a class called Complex for performing arithmetic with complex
//numbers. Complex numbers have the form
//realPart + imaginaryPart * i
//where i is sqrt(-1)
//Write a program to test your class. Use floating-point variables to represent the private data of the
//class. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when itâ€™s declared.
//Provide a no-argument constructor with default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide
//public methods that perform the following operations:
//a) Add two Complex numbers: The real parts are added together and the imaginary parts
//are added together.
//b) Subtract two Complex numbers: The real part of the right operand is subtracted from
//the real part of the left operand, and the imaginary part of the right operand is subtracted
//from the imaginary part of the left operand.
//c) Print Complex numbers in the form (realPart, imaginaryPart).
